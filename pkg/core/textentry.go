// value accessor: on some drivers an empty input reports its hint, so "Username"
// comes back whether or not anything was typed. A reading that did not change
// therefore proves nothing, and is reported as unverifiable rather than acted
// on.
//
// The check is deliberately a suffix rather than an equality: every mobile text
// path appends to whatever the field already held, and the caller would
// otherwise have to spend a round trip reading the field before typing just to
// know what to expect.
//
// Two shapes are accepted beyond an exact suffix:
//
//   - A secure field reports its value as bullets, one per character. Comparing
//     text would fail on every password in every suite, so a masked value of the
//     right length counts as landed — and the secret is never read.
//   - A value that differs but is no shorter than what was typed has been
//     rewritten by the app (a formatter, an autocomplete, an input mask).
//     Retyping reproduces it, so it is reported separately from a real loss.
//   - A field that reports no value at all is unverifiable, not failed. Custom
//     inputs, Flutter's EditableText and some WebView controls all do this.
//
// A value that is present, unmasked and does not end with what was typed is the
